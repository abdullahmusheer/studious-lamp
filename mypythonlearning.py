def function123(name, age: int):
    
    print(f"happy birthday {name}, good luck on your {age}😁")


# def happy_birthday():
#     gay_friend = input("enter your gay friends name:")
#     his_age = input("enter his age:")
#     for i in range(3):
#         print(f"happy {his_age} birthday gay {gay_friend} bro (❁´◡`❁)👌😘")
    
function123("sam",24)
